# Some_platformer,

Test of making a platformer with JavaFX..

This project might be something of a mess, but it is meant for me
learning how to implement different things into a game.

Things as animation of characters, proper collision detection by just 
editing a simple .png file and the drawing and spawning of different 
tiles depending on the pixels rgb value.

Also including camera and parallax scrolling among other things that
I am probably forgetting.

The games graphics is made out of free images i found in several places
around the internet. It does not really make sense atm and the
graphics just don't fit with each other for the scenarios.
But once again this is about learning.

Game is played using the arrow keys and using F for fire and G for
grenades atm. I also want to test to integrate controllers as well.

Game grenades and bullets don't kill enemies yet. Other things to
add is bullet and grenade drops as well as a health bar and so on.
