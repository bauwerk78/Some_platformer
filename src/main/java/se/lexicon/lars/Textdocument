you need to split the whole thing into two cases
if the player coordinate is exactly on an edge, so (pX / 64) * 64 == pX, then only tile you need to check is (pX / 64, pY / 64 + 1)
if that's not solid, then you should fall
oh, you're going from the center?
yeah, ok, bit of a change
if (pX / 64) * 64 == pX - 32, then you need to check one tile, at (pX / 64, pY / 64 + 1)
otherwise you need to also check the tile (pX / 64 + 1, pY / 64 + 1)
in the second case you're falling if both are empty, in the first one if it's empty you're falling
if you don't want to split the two cases, you can also just check
(floor((pX - 32) / 64.0f), pY / 64 + 1) and (ceil((pX - 32) / 64.0f), pY / 64 + 1)
in case you're exactly on an edge, those two will be the same tile, and would still work
